## üß† Overview

This repository provides the PyTorch implementation of S2CAC (Scoring-driven Semi-supervised Coronary Artery Calcium Segmentation), a novel framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled CT data for accurate coronary artery calcium segmentation.

* **A dual-path hybrid transformer architecture** that combines 3D CNNs and Transformers to jointly predict pixel-level segmentation maps and volume-level CAC scores.
* **Scoring-driven consistency** between predicted scores and segmentation-derived scores to improve supervision from unlabeled data.
* **Negative Sample Boosting** to better exploit hard negative samples during training.

## üì¶ Environment Setup

Install all dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìÅ Dataset Preparation

Our method relies on the **nnUNet-style data preprocessing**.

### Option 1: Using nnUNet preprocessing (recommended)

1. Preprocess your dataset using [nnUNet's instructions](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet).
2. Update the `data_preprocessed` field in `config.json` to point to the preprocessed data path.

### Option 2: Using your own data pipeline

If you have a custom data preprocessing or loading method, modify the function `get_dataloaders()` in `training_semi_score.py` accordingly.

---

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training

1. Adjust the hyperparameters in `config.json`.
2. Start training:

```bash
python training_semi_score.py
```

The script will automatically handle semi-supervised learning, consistency regularization, and negative sample mining.

## üîç Inference

We provide pretrained model weights.

### Step 1: Download weights

* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1PPioMvbiPIjjDa__RggQ3QUioJAeBn/view?usp=drive_link)
* [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1De1Vdc0L-N9aHyFhdUDC5w?pwd=far4)

Place the downloaded model weights into the `model_weight/` folder.

### Step 2: Prepare test data

Put your NIfTI (`.nii.gz`) files into the `test_data/` folder.

### Step 3: Run inference

```bash
python test_from_file.py
```

Segmentations will be saved automatically.
